   <div class=answer> <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p> To make sure that I was productive and kept up to date with all information I needed to add, I was able to use trello. Trello allowed me to keep track of everything that I was doing and needed to do. This was extremely helpful for me when I become stuck on what I needed to do next. The only draw back of using trello is that I would have to go onto a seperate webpage and edit it myself, which took time to do. If I working a in a team, we would have been quicker in our production of making a website, This is because we could have worked together on different projects at the same time and then conbined them, creating a functioning website a lot quicker than just one person working on everything. By working together in a team you would also be able to spot any problems quicker and resolve them.</p> </div>
    


    <div class=answer> <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>I should have done better time management when creating my webpage, this is because I didn't expect completing and adding in the writing would take a long time. I also found it to be important to do the research before you start your webpage and not during, this is so you already have the idea's you want to add onto your page and don't waste more time looking into more different options to be adding on when you are trying to complete it for a deadline. When selecting everything you need to add to your webpage, it makes it a lot simplier to add in instead of trying to find the right thing you want while making the web page.</p></div>



    <div class=answer> <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
    <p>Next time I would make sure I have a good understanding of what it is that I need to do for my webpage. This is so I already have an understanding of what I need to do instead of just a breif and then adding new things while I am finishing off my webpage. This would allow me to create a webpage quicker and better. I used slack so that I could keep up to date with everyone in my group and so I could make sure I was on track with the rest of my class. If I was to make another webpage I would like to work in a team as we would be able to do it quicker and also make parts of everyones ideas so we are able to include different ideas that one person might not of thought of.</p></div>



    <div class=answer> <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>To test my webpage, I sent the link to friends and family who were able to use the website and see how it ran from a different computer. When I got my feedback I knew what it was that I needed to add or change and what I knew worked well and so I didn't have to change. This was helpful to get outsider feedback as I didn't always know if something was easy to understand for everyone. I wanted my website to be user-friendly and by asking people who I knew didn't use computers/webpages often, I was able to get the feedback needed to see how friendly the site is, and if it wasn't I was given feedback on what I could do to improve it.</p></div>
