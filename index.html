     <p >My name is Emily Ward, I am 23 years old and now studying a coding course before I go to University in September. <br/> <br/> The course I am currently learning is at <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/"target="_blank">Code Nation. </a> The course is Level 2 Develop Coding, and has showed me the basics to get me started, this includes creating a game and making a webpage.  <br/> <br/>I have always made sure that I keep up to date about IT as it is now used every day and the use of IT and different programs is especially important to help find work in this field. I am enjoying studying this course as it has showed me the behind the scenes look at how websites and games work. I enjoy playing computer/console games in my free time and use different websites/apps everyday so as I start to understand the programming and time that goes into making sure everything works well and is also easy to use for everyone.<br/> <br/> With help from my mum’s passion for tech, I was able to know about new technologies (Computer/gaming) that came out, and I learned what goes into the computer case to make it run efficiently. Me and my mum were able to make our own computer with all the parts that make it work effectively, and we are now able to update individual parts whenever a newer or better part comes out, this could include the graphics card, CPU, or the hard drive. <br/> <br/> Now that I have started to properly learn code, during lessons and doing my own research, I am enjoying it and learning new things everyday.</p>
