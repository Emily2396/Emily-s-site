<div class=answer1> <h3>1.1	Describing the content and layout for each page</h3> 
    <p>The home page is a basic description of me. Throughout my webpages I have included plants as it something that I enjoy, I have made sure that all the content is still readable but still showing the pictures behind, I used transparency for that. <br><br>
        Outcome1/2/3, This page shows my answers for outcome 1/2/3. I have separated each question and answer by using a heading and paragraph to change them. As the background has changed, I have changed the colour scheme. The colour scheme also changes depending what page you are on; this was so I could make sure I was able to test out different themes and practice using the CSS. Unit2, this has the same theme as outcome 1/2/3 just with a different colour scheme. <br><br>
        Contact me, this is the most simple page as I wanted to make sure that the contact details were easy to find and display nicely.

<div class=answer1> <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <p>Constraints of copyright. The copyright law started in the UK in 1711, it helped to protect plays and books for authors and among other things. The law was later changed to Designs and Patents Act 1988. This was because of the change in time, as more music/films/TV shows had became more and more popular. After some more time, it became clear that they needed to include more literary works as computer programs has started to came about, so in 1992 It was extended.<a href = "https://copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p01_uk_copyright_law"target="_blank">[1].</a> The copyright law now protects:</p>
        <ul class=list>
        <li>original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including illustration and photography</li>
        <li>original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases sound and music recordings</li>
        <li>film and television recordings</li>
        <li>broadcasts</li>
        <li>the layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works</li>
    </ul>
    <p> These days it is very common and almost expected for a website to be able to cross platform. This means that the webpage can change its CSS style from computer broswer to phone browser making it more accessible and easier to read on a phone. As for computers phones can have different opersating systems such as windows and IOS. Iphones/Imacs would use safari for their browsers and that can sometimes create problems with downloads.

<div class=answer1> <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
    <p>When designing a website that is being used by a whole county, it must be accessible for all. A good example of a website that needs to be accessible to all is the <a href = "https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/" ="_blank">UK government digital service.</a> As this website could be used by anyone in the UK, it has multiple changes that you can implement onto the site, that includes:
    <ul class=list>
        <li>Being able to zoom in on the text on the webpage so anyone is able to read it</li>
        <li>Screen reader. There is a large button on a page that when clicked it will read out the whole page to the person</li>
        <li>Speech recogniton. Being able to use you voice to navigate the site</li>
        <li>Change the colour/font of the page to suit the persons eyes better</li>
        <li>and more</li>
        </ul>
    It is important to remember of every person who might be visiting your webpage. If your page isn't user-friendly it can discourage people from visiting the site if they feel they can not understand and/or use the site.

<div class=answer1> <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
    <p> While creating a website you will come across many different filetypes that you could use. Chosing which ones you want to use and why can sometimes make no difference or all the difference, and knowing which ones do/dont is important. I have listed some one the filetypes I have used and others I could have.
        <ul class=list>
            <li>PNG. Portable Network Graphics. This is used for high-quality images. This file type helps keep the quality of a photo so when you copy and paste it will retain its quality.PNG includes images without a background too. The only downside of PNG is that the images can take up a lot of storage and so increase the webpages loadtime.</li>
            <li>GIF. Graphics Interchange Format, is a small looping animation. Basic animations can make a website a little different, like simple designs for businesses can be a nice addition but a GIF that isn't simple can display poorly and so making the website look like professional. </li>
            <li>PFD. Portable Document Format. This file is used for online documents and printing. A PDF can contain different elements such as photos, tect, audio and more. This filetype is good as it always keeps its formatting no matter what device it is on but you must have a PDF reader to be able to view it.</li>
            <li>MP4. Moving Picture Experts Group. This is a video. This kind of file can contain, video, audio, and subtiles. The compression format works so well that it can create a lightweight file that is easily loaded on websites.</li>
            <li>MP3. Moving Picture Experts Group(MPEG) Audio Layer-3. this is an audio file saved in a compressed audio format. A mp3 would need to have a Media player to be able to add on to a webpage. </li>
            </ul>
