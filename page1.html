    <div class = answer> <h3>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h3>
    <p >The purpose of IT in modern businesses is because it allows a wider range of customers to be able to browse and buy their stocking. Businesses are able to advertise their products with proper descriptions and also reviews from previous customers, which allows the consumer to get a better understanding of each product before they buy, the customer would most likely not have the same experience if they went into a store. <br/> <br/> With the use of IT, small businesses and start-ups can set up without having to rent a shop or warehouse, which gives them a better chance of making a profit. Small businesses can advertise their product on different platforms and can make their market a lot bigger compared to opening a shop in a town, in which people may have to travel to. Different platforms, such as, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, allow shops to show off their products by using video, those platforms also allow to put links for the websites so the once the consumer has watched the video and is interested in the product, they can be sent to the official website where they are able to buy the products. A lot of social media has also added the feature which allows people to buy and pay through the social media site it is found on, this has made it easier than having to transfer to the website and having to find It again. According to Business demography, UK: 2018, 89% of start-ups founded in 2017 survived the first year <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/businessdemography/2018#which-industries-have-the-highest-business-births-and-deaths"target="_blank"> [1]</a>. Which is a huge success for many businesses. Online businesses have allowed people to be able to do things from their own home also widened the types of stock people are able to buy. <br/> <br/> To conclude online ordering is bigger than ever in recent years, and this has allowed many businesses to progress quicker and to a wider audience. </p> </div>


<div class = answer>  <h3>1.2	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
    <p>To create a digital project it is very important to have at least a basic understanding of how to use the programs needed to create your digital projects. The knowledge that is needed to know can be learned quickly and easily. The most common way to learn about the programs needed to use is through an online course, and by completing an online course you are able to learn in our own time, with all the resources you need. After applying to an online course you will need to download the software that allows you to produce the code you need. The software most commonly used to start off with is Virtual Studio Code. Now is time to learn is coding Language JavaScript and Python are important and easy coding scripts that most commonly used to create digital projects and those are taught when first learning. <br/> <br/> Now that the basics have you learned, next thing you will need learn is the HTML and CSS. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, this is used for coding the content that will be on your webpage. It has been used since the 90s and has been an important part of web developing since then. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, this is used to style your webpage, this includes the colour of the page, the background, and placement of all the elements. <br/> <br/> After completing your course, it is now important to understand if you have the pysical equipment needed to get started. Depending on the circumstances you would first need to decide if you need to have a laptop or desktop.
    <ul>
        <li>If you needed to travel a lot for your work, the best choice is to use a laptop. Before picking your laptop, it is important to understand how big your webpage is going to be, what amount of storage, which CPU is needed.</li>
        <li>If you are not travelling and able to set up at home or in an office, a desktop would best for you. Depending on your knowledge of desktops you can find what you need in store or customize your own, by customizing you are able to add newer components whenever you need.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Those are the basics you need to learn to get started with creating your very own webpage. </p> </div>  
    


    <div class = answer><h3> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
    <p>While creating a webpage it is important to keep track of what it is that needs to be done. By creating a Trello it makes it easier to follow what is needed to do, what is currently being done, and what has been completed. I found this very helpful as I can sometimes lose track in what I am doing. I also found this good as I was able to put everything I had to do, so I wouldn't forget even the little of things. On my trello page, I used colour codes to show where I was up to on my progress. Red = not done, yellow = doing, green = done.
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    <p>By clicking the image below, it will take you to my trello page that shows my progress.</p>

    <div class = answer><h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects ‚Äì what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <p>Before starting anything it is extremely important to have the correct equipment. Internet connection being the first start. If the internet doesn‚Äôt work or it has a very slow connection it can be difficult to communicate quickly and efficiently with customers causing them to lose interest or look elsewhere with the product they‚Äôre interested in. Another part of the equipment that is VERY important to remember is having a computer that is able to keep up with the demand running a website has, if the computer fails, so does the business. <br/> <br/> When creating a digital project it is important to have goals, unless you have goals to reach you can become unmotivated to reach the potential that you could have. This could be simply setting a goal of selling 25 products in one week, you can motivate yourself to advertise more often, recommend your product to friends and family. It is also important to be able to understand the demand your product could have, sometimes being overprepared can cause a loss in profits, as you might have too much stock to reach a profit at the start.<a href = "https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/reasons-why-most-online-business-startups-fail/"target="_blank">[2]</a> <br/> <br/> By having a website that is user-friends is one of the most important things you could have. It is important to understand who your target audience is, if you are looking towards elderly or those without much experience using websites, it is important to have clear information about your products and clear tabs so that the person would be able to understand where they need to look on the website for particular things. By having a website that is making sure everything fits in well to the webpage, all the elements work properly and do not become mixed together, this will make the webpage look professional.<a href = "https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/reasons-why-most-online-business-startups-fail/"target="_blank">[2]</a> <br/> <br/> Having a social media presence would also make you look more professional. It allows you to update your customers more often and also to communicate with customers better. When having a business social media it is important to keep it strictly business and make sure it is up to date along with your website, a problem that can occur when running a social media is forgetting about it and not staying committed to updating it along with your website. <a href = "https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/reasons-why-most-online-business-startups-fail/"target="_blank">[2]</a>

    <div class = answer><h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
    <p>After completing a course for coding and having a basic understanding of IT systems and softwares that are needed to create a proper digial project, you can start looking for what needs you will have for your own project. This could be your chance to explore different softwares that you are able to use. Below I have listed the more commonly used softwares and information needed to progess your webpage.
    <ul>
        <li>Virtial Studio Code. One of the newer and more popular softwares to use is Virtial Studio Code, or VS code. This software is known for being simple to use and easy to learn. VS code is a software that has allowed all the different lanuages in coding are able to be conbined easily.</li>
        <li>Code Pen. Code pen is an online code editor that allows people to learn while they code. It is a community of web developers that use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so they are able to work together when needed and code little parts for eachothers projects. This has created a place where new coders and experienced coders can show off their skills and give feedback to eachother on any problems or ways they could improve their projects.</li>
        <li>Will you be travelling a lot while working? If so, having a laptop that will be able to store and run the programs needed is important to think about when starting a digial project. Once you have found the correct laptop, you will be able to keep up to date on all the things you need.</li>
        <li>If you are working from home, you would be to set up a desktop which allows you to customize and add storge when needed. There is a lot more options when looking for a desktop compared to a laptop and so if you do happen to be ou and about a lot more, you could write down notes on your phone and then update your project once you arrive home or at work, wherever the desktop is being kept.</li>
    </ul>

     <div class = answer> <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
     <p>While creating my own webpage I have found that using trello has allowed me to keep track of what I need to do and so I have been able to add all the features I wanted to include. I have added my own trello board for my webpage in a previous answer.<br/> <br/> I have also used trello on a previous project where I was in a team with 3 others and we created a game. By using trello, we were able to delegate jobs for eachother as trello allows a colour code for each task. While on this project we also used draw.io which we could make a flowchart on. The flowchart was so we could plan our game timeline and also show all the different points and endings we included in this game. This was extremely helpful when it came to creating the code for the game as we already had a plan. </p> </div>



     <div class = answer> <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h3>
     <p>GDPR. General data protection regulation. On the 25th may 2018, the EU implemented GDPR. This was brought to the attention of the EU in January 2012 as we were entering the 'digital age', the public needed to know that when they gave thier information to websites when signing up, thier personal information would be save.The GDPR makes sure that personal data has to be given legally and should not be collected and managed so it can be protected from misuse and exploitaion. The punishment for failing to do this can be very serere. Any Organisation inside the EU has to follow this regulation, this also includes any company outside of EU that has services or customers inside the EU. What kind of data is protected under this law? name, address, and photos. It can also include genetic or biometric data.<a href = "https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/eu-data-protection-rules_en" target="_blank">[3]</a> </p> </div>
