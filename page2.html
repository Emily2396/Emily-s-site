    <div class=wel><h1>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful</h1></div>

    <div class=answer><h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
    <p>While creating this webpage I have learned many new skills that have helped me. The use of VS code has helped me a lot and has made it simple and easy to understand while I am writing. When I have made a mistake it is easy to find and understand what I have done wrong. I have enjoyed using this software and as I am new to code and found it very insteresting to learn. With new technologies always being brought out, it is important to keep up to date in understanding how things are made and with VS code it is always being updated which allows the best experience while using.</p></div>



    <div class=answer><h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>  
    <p>By using VS code, it allowed me to learn quickly and undertand how things run properly and efficiently, it is easy to see if there is a problem with the code and it also shows where the problem is. By using code pen, i was able to show off my code and get feed back from the coding community which has shown me simplier ways how i could layout my coding. This has also showed me shortcuts and have a better understanding of how my code runs and is made. Trello has been very helpful to keep me up to date and know what is left to be done. It is easy to use and I can update it all the time to show my progress.</p></div>



    <div class=answer><h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3> 
    <p>I am very happy with my progess on my website, I have found ways to make it look simple and easy to understand. I like the idea that I have placed many links to references I have used, as well as a link to my trello through the trello logo, this is to make it easy to understand. I really like how I was able to add in my own images and adapt them to my own style. I made sure that everything is easy to read and in place. The things I would change about my website would be to be able to spend more time on writing out my answers. I would also like to do more research on how I could make my website more unique compared to others, this could be adding in effects onto my website, this inculdes maybe adding sound effects. While doing research for my website I also found different ways I could make it different from others, I could add in scrolling text or images to show different photographs on different pages. </p> </div>



    <div class=answer><h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
    <p>While doing more research on different things I could of added if i had more time to learn and understand the coding of it, I would have added in more effects that allow more information to be shown, such as different tabs that could collapse and open so the answers are hidden unless you are wanting to read them. This would make the page look less crowded. Another improvement I would have included is a search bar,this would make it so the person on my webpage could easily find what they are looking for and so it makes it easier to locate different things on my website.</p></div>



    <div class=answer><h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3> 
    <p>On my webpage I have made sure to include everything I have learned during my lessons. This is so that I can show that I have understood what I have learned and also put it into practice. I think that it is important to show this as you can pratice all the different skills and code you've learned. All so the code that I have added to my webpage works well and connects to all other parts of my page. I have also done my own research on different types of code so that my page can look different from others. By doing my own research I was able to add in highlighted navigation (.hover) and it helps when selecting what you would like to select. </p></div>
